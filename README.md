# TrianglesAndSquares
Project made for academic course Mathematical Methods of Optimization. Program is trying to approximate given image with limited number of geometric figures (let's stick to triangles for now :D). User can choose which type of algorithm to use:
- single parent (hill climbing algorithm)
- population based algorithm (Bees algorithm)
